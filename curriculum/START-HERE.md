# 👋 Start Here: Learning Java for Robots

Welcome! If you've programmed in **Blocks**, you already know more than you think. These lessons
teach the same ideas in **Java**, the language real FTC and FRC teams use, one small step at a time.

You'll work through the lessons **mostly on your own**, at your own pace. Everything you need is
written down, with pictures. Your teacher is there when you're really stuck.

---

## How to get started
1. **Do [Lesson 00](lessons/00-getting-the-code.md) first.** It sets up your laptop, your
   group's copy of the code, and your own folder. Every step has a picture.
2. **Then go in order: 01, 02, 03…** Each lesson builds on the one before.
3. **Every class:** pull when you sit down, push before you leave (see the
   [daily routine](lessons/00-getting-the-code.md#daily-routine)).

## How each lesson works
Every lesson has the same parts:

| Section | What you do |
|---|---|
| **Before you start** | Pull, then copy the lesson's program into your own folder. |
| **📖 Learn it** | Read the explanation and look at the diagram. This is the new idea. |
| **1. Predict** | Read the code and **guess** what it will do. Write it down! Guessing wrong is fine. That's how you learn. |
| **2. Run** | Put it on the robot and see if you were right. |
| **3. Investigate** | Answer questions and try small experiments to see *why* it works. |
| **4. Modify** | Make small changes to the working code. |
| **5. Make** | Build something new with the idea. |
| **✅ Check yourself** | A checklist. If you can do all of it, move on. |
| **🆘 Stuck?** | Fixes for the most common problems in that lesson. |

### Hints are hidden on purpose
Some questions have a hint you can open:

Like this! Try the problem on your own for a few minutes **before** you open a hint. The
struggle is where the learning happens.

## When you're stuck, in this order
1. **Read the error message.** Click it in Android Studio's **Build** panel to jump to the line.
2. Check the lesson's **🆘 Stuck?** table.
3. Check the [**Blocks → Java cheat sheet**](reference/blocks-to-java.md).
4. **Ask a classmate** to look with you. Explaining your code out loud often shows you the bug.
5. **Ask your teacher.**

## Two program types you'll see
| | **TeleOp** (driver control) | **Autonomous** |
|---|---|---|
| Who's in charge | A driver with a gamepad | The program, all by itself |
| Driver Station list | The **TeleOp** list (right) | The **Autonomous** list (left) |
| Code line | `@TeleOp(...)` | `@Autonomous(...)` |
